                    My name is <strong>Biswas Parajuli</strong>. I am from Nepal. I am a professional website developer. I love creating modern, clean, and user-friendly websites and sharing my coding knowledge. <b class="bg-primary p-1 suggestText">I work primarily with a focus on frontend, responsive design, and user experience (UX).</b> My goal is for everyone to have basic knowledge of coding in today's world.
                    This website is specifically for those who want to code or are coding.<br><br>

                    My journey began with a curiosity about how a website is built. I learned how to build a website by watching various social media, YouTube tutorials, etc. I was wondering whether I should give priority to templates or create them through coding. After thinking about it for a few days, I decided that coding would be best for me. Templates have limited features, but if you learn coding well, you can make it however you want, so I chose coding.Today, I have been able to turn various basic ideas into websites.
                    In my opinion, a good website is not just about looking good. In my opinion, when the <b class="bg-warning p-1">code is clean, SEO friendly, responsive, and speed optimized</b>, then a good website is created. <br><br>

                    I also enjoy extracurricular activities along with coding. I really enjoy writing and reading literature, such as stories and poetry.  
                    Currently I am working on various useful projects which will make me a better portfolio and a better web maker.
